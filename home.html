  <div id="What Is FGM">

<h2 style="background-color:palevioletred;">What Is FGM?</h2>
<p style= "font-family:'Times New Roman',Times, serif;" style="color:black;" style="font-size: 26px">
    <h3>So What is FGM?</h3>
    FGM or “Female Genital Mutilation” is a non-medical procedure typically performed on young girls to alter or completely remove their genitalia. 
    There are four types of FGM: from left to right we can observe that the severity of mutilation increases as noted by the amount of flesh removal (shown in purple). 
    Most cases (~90%) fall under type 1, which is a clitoridectomy, and it is the partial or complete removal of the external clitoris. 
    The other 10% of cases usually fall under type three, which is infibulation, and is the removal and alteration of the clitoris, labia minoria, and labia majora followed by the sealant of the vaginal opening. 
    This procedure leaves the victims with only a small hole for menstrual blood and urine and is commonly healed by binding the victim’s legs together so as to not rip the stitches open. 
    However, there is another rare case, which is the removal of the clitoris, labia minoria and sometimes the labia majora and would classify as type 2. Lastly, type 4 can be classified as any other harmful non-medical procedure that does not fall into the earlier three types such as burning, scraping, etc. 
    The illustration, provided by the END FGM European Network organization does an in depth job explaining all four types, and we heavily recommend you check out their page. (link in sources under the More button).

    <h3>Why is FGM bad?</h3>
    FGM is commonly performed on girls, typically under fifteen years of age and are performed without consent and reasons not medically necessary.
    There are no clear benefits to FGM other than to satisfy cultural expectations and sometimes religious beliefs. According to the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), there is no tolerance from the UN for this practice as it violates the fundamental rights of girls and women. 
    There is an international sentiment against FGM and arguments against banning it can be be found from an anthropological perspective. As two indivduals, and above all, women, we believe that FGM should be banned internationally. Why? Because as women who are privileged to live the lives we do, we must advocate for fellow girls and women who do not have a voice. 
    We must advocate for those whose pain goes unnoticed by the outside world. In fact, bevcause of questionable procedural methods and lack of sanitation, girls experience intense pain and shock that may follow them for the rest of their lives. Moreover, excess bleeding from these procedures almost always occurs along with risks of infections and sometimes death. 
    Unfortunately, years later, many women who have been cut almost always report physical, sexual, and psychological complications. 
    FGM can also lead to complications during pregnancy as it can be much more difficult to conduct testing, such as obtaining clear urine samples. Furthermore, studies found that FGM is accompanied by increased risk to the mother and the additional deaths of 10-20 babies (per 1,000 babies) according the World Health Organization (WHO).

    <h3>Where is FGM practiced?</h3>
    To start off, it is hard to claim that this practice is “widespread” across the globe as FGM rates are associated with sub-national ethnicities such as in the case of Iraq where FGM is mostly found to occur among two ethnicities. 
    With this in mind, FGM is most commonly practiced in African countries such as Somalia, Guinea and Djibouti. 
    Additionally, FGM victims tend to be from more rural areas as it is unusual to find cut girls from wealthy families except in the case of those living in Sudan and Somalia. 
    It is also a bit ironic to note that in these countries, an increase in educational access for women is accompanied by an increased rate of FGM. This is not the case with other countries. 
    Thankfully, there is a recent downward trend in the percentage of women (ages 15-49) who have undergone FGM in these countries; but, much work still remains to be done.

    <h3>How is FGM practiced?</h3>
    FGM is practiced usually in unsanitary environment using unsterilized equipment such as scissors and sharp pieces of glass. Worse yet, sometimes the same cutting device is used to cut multiple girls without sanitizing in-between. 
    In most cases, the patient is not under anesthesia and is forced to lie down by women of her community during the procedure. The person cutting the girls is usually an older woman, but this is not always the case. 
    Some medical professionals also practice FGM, such as in Egypt where over 70% of these procedures are conducted by medical professionals. 

    <h3>Why is FGM still practiced?</h3>
    As previously mentioned FGM is mostly practiced due to societal pressures. 
    Fueled by gender inequality, many see this as a rite of passage to womanhood. 
    Some even view women who are cut as more honorable and pure. 
    To expand, women who are cut are perceived to be preserving their virginity, allowing for increased male sexual pleasure, and earning their right to marry. 
    Religious beliefs can also play into the importance given to FGM, but there is no evidence in any mainstream scriptures supporting this practice. 
    Surveys conducted in some countries like Egypt reveal that most people believe FGM is required by religion but this is a difficult conclusion to make due to the vague distinctions the general population makes between religion and culture. 
    It is even mostly women who choose to cut their daughters due to the fear that failure to do so will lead to their daughters to be ostracized from society. Bluntly speaking, FGM is a crime against women that is organized by women. 
    It is a cycle often encouraged by the lack of information in countries where FGM is mainly practiced.

    <h3>Is FGM a problem in America?</h3>
    Even though FGM is most commonly associated with countries in Africa and Asia, this procedure was actually performed regularly by doctors in America up until the 1980s, most notably in immigrant communities and metropolitan areas. 
    Reasons mostly included treating sexual and psychological disorders. Federally, FGM is a prohibited procedure for anyone under 18 thanks to the STOP FGM Act of 2020. 
    The law also requires congress to collect data about FGM risks in the United States. On a state level, 40 states have banned FGM with the other 10 having undefined laws about it. 
    Internationally, the United States has participated in multiple United Nations’ summits that have called for the criminalization of FGM such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. 
    Thankfully, the cases of FGM in the United States have decreased but this does not mean it is still not an issue. Unfortunately due to factors such as lack of data, it is unclear how prevalent this issue remains in modern context. 
    However, in a 2016 report by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, it is estimated that a over ~500,000 girls and women are at risk of FGM with around a third of that population being underaged. 
    It is safe to say that while the issue is not as serious as it is in other countries, there is still much work to be done about FGM in America.

    Please note that the information given above is to provide only an introductory explanation about FGM. 
    It is therefore not meant to be a detailed, encompassing explanation about this complicated topic. 
    We heavily encourage viewers to explore FGM in further detail and especially to read through the articles linked in the “Sources” tab for more information.

<div id="What You Can Do">
<h2 style="background-color:palevioletred;">What You Can Do</h2>
<p style= "font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;" style="color:black;">
    <h3> What You Can Do to Help?</h3>
    Even though most of us do not live within communities that take part in this harmful practice, social media is a powerful tool that connects us with the world. 
    It might seem difficult to believe the actions that you commit online to spread awareness could help girls in villages with no internet connection, but leaders of countries in which these villages belong to may see the efforts made online and thus take action. Using relevant hashtags on social media such as #endFGM could result in more people seeing posts about FGM-related content. 
    It is also important to recognize signs that someone may be being coerced into FGM such as ceremonies to celebrate a girl being “ready” for marriage or missing long periods of classes. 
    While we do not expect to face such issues typically in the western part of the world, it is certainly possible and we should at least learn to spot potential signs. 
    Lastly, donate to organizations and activists that are trying to end this practice. Support their websites and other social platforms so that their message can potentially reach more people. Below are some organizations that are definitely worth looking into:

<p style= "font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;" style = "color:black;">
    Our names are Areebah Khandaker and Emily Yao, and we were around sixteen years old when we first learned about this topic in our english class--a topic some other girls were unfortunately forcefully and brutally introduced to. As mentioned previously, FGM is usually performed on young girls less than fifteen. When we were fifteen, all we were worried about was making new friends and still adjusting to high school, so it absolutely breaks our hearts to know that somewhere else in the world, so many other fifteen year olds and younger went through FGM. Thus, we wanted to shed light on this issue by creating this website.
    There was only one problem: neither of us knew how to make a website. However, due to our perseverance and passion for this subject, our project was born. While neither of us were personally impacted
    by FGM, we believe that injustice to women anywhere is injustice to women EVERYWHERE. Therefore, we urge you to learn, discuss, and share resources about FGM. 
    As Martin Luther King Jr. eloquently once said, "Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter."
